👋 Hey, I’m Ana: Algorithm Alchemist, Salsa-Dancing Coder, & Botanical Debugger!

When I’m not turning data structures into art 🎨⚡ or teaching my plants to photosynthesize in hex code 🌿💻, you’ll catch me salsa-stepping through CI/CD pipelines or meditating on why recursion still feels like magic. ✨💃🧘♀️

✨ The Tea (Served Freshly Steeped):

🦸♀️ Coding Superpower: I wrangle algorithms like a circus pro—arrays juggled, trees balanced, and graphs traversed before my tea gets cold. 🎪📊⏳ (O(1) patience for O(n²) problems.)

💻 Language Love: Scala’s my loyal sidekick 🐾 (functional sass, immutability for days), but I’m sprinting toward Go’s concurrency playground. 🏃♀️🚀 (Race you to the goroutine finish line!)

🍵 Fuel of Choice: Matcha lattes > coffee. My code compiles on antioxidant power alone. 💚✨

🌿 Hobbies That Don’t Involve Screens:

Botanical Therapist: My plants get more git log updates than my repos. 🌱🔍

Salsa Syntax: Coding by day, spinning by night—my IDE autocompletes and counts beats. 💃🔥

Yoga Yoda: Mastered the art of debugging in downward dog. 🧘♀️🐛 (“Breathe through the segfault…”)

🚀 Collab Vibes:

Let’s build Scala apps smoother than a cha-cha slide, or Go microservices faster than my salsa spins! 💃🐿️

Teamwork = 50% PR reviews, 50% sharing obscure tea facts, 100% ”Wait, that actually worked?!”

📫 Reach Me:

Ping me like a GET request to my soul 📡🍵

Pro Tip: Send rare tea memes or salsa playlists for a VIP response. 🎶🌿

⚠️ Fun Fact: I debug with a teapot in one hand and a keyboard in the other. The secret? Green tea and sheer audacity. 🫖💻

🌱 Let’s code mindfully, laugh recklessly, and keep our indentation zen!
Compiling serenity since [insert git commit date here]. 🙏✨
